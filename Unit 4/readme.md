# Lab 4: Operation System, Graphics

# Executive Summary

The purpose of Lab 4 is Professor Manjula's assignments. They give us tools website designers have while designing websites. Bridging Chapter 2, websites can be visually appealing but visually unreadable, so color contrasting matters. And operating systems involve many program types so including a section to navigate operating systems matters.

# Graphics

## Raster vs. Vector Graphics

* Explain the difference between a raster and vector image.  

I do not know why dots are called raster.

Professor Manjula, I think vectors are shapeless, why? The velocity, space per time, and direction, space, do not include specific examples at time never to occur again, they are new. Because if vectors are real, they happen at time t. If time never existed, space should be formless. In an image vector, velocity (space per time outside display) is constant as light speed. And users define the variable as size. What do you say?

What raster images do are show pixels, their space, including distortion. A raster photographer's distance from the image can be calculated using the photographer's height, camera zoom as optical length and curvature angle, and software percent zoom. Technically a raster image is a real-life photo in space, meters, and at time, seconds. If raster imaged photos pixels are different, then vector imaged pixels can be changed. Vector image photos are space-only. Digitally produced, they lack time. You will never see a sun or moon in real space-time inside a vector image. 

I think they are written as mathematical equations. The user creates the problem. *I want an image of a starfish the size of 500pixels by 500 pixels.* The user handles tools to resize an image. As the user creates a starfish too large, the pixels exceed 500x500. As the user shrinks the image toward 500x500, the equation remained and will always remain the same. In design space x, x equals the spacial inputs, y = pixels, the solution. For instance, customizable in software are variables like x. The constants of equation y = 5x^2 times 8.67x plus 2.5 make the quadratic unique and a shape. However it has its dependent variable x and thus users can change its dimensions without distortion. At velocity x, x equals x as the object travels at time y. The velocity defines time, nature is "constant".

* Include examples of when each would be most appropriate 

Rasters are truths. Raster answers the question *When?* That one, not this one. They are different because this one is flying. The airplane flew to Guam. Then flew back. 

Vectors are illustrations. Vector answers the question *What?* An airplane. Not a helicopter. A helicopter is rotary-winged aircraft. An airplane is a fixed-wing aircraft.

## Lossless vs. Lossy Compression

* Why does it matter to developers whether they use lossless or lossy image formats?  

Developers want the best image. Developers know file size matters if users experience high latency. File size makes or breaks an application. What worsens an image is lossy image formats. What preserves an image is lossless image formats. Why users discontinue application usage can be because worse images or high latency times. That is why it matters to developers.

## File Formats

* Explain the similarities and differences between jpeg, gif and png files. 

Professor Manjula, jpg, gif and png files are images. They are Joint Photographic Experts Group, Graphics Interchange Format, and Portable Network Graphics.

Likewise, just as JPG does not allow for animated images, PNG does not allow for animated images. Alternatively, JPEG allows for quality losses.

Just as GIF does not allow for lossy compression, PNG does not allow for lossy compression. Alternatively, GIF allows for animated images.


# Operating Systems

Upload screenshots for Operating System tasks to github

## Logo

* Upload your logo image that you created from the Graphics Tasks

* Explain your image design including how many "layers" were required

Papa John's Pizza is my choice for our Vectr graphic design. Our sign at Papa John's is a banner red, green, and white in color. Like Italian cuisine, Papa John's Pizza values tomato sauce, spices, and white cheese. Lamination prevents dirtiness and contamination of your food. You will see an ellipse filled with what I call "a powdered white translucent lamination." I required 3 layers. 

* Right-click on your svg image file, select "properties" and report the file size and what application it "opens with." What application might be more appropriate and why (click the "change" button for options)
 
Opens with: Google Chrome
Size: 376KB (385,279 bytes)
Size on disk: 380KB (389,120 bytes)
 
I searched for changes and I think Google Chrome is most appropriate.
 
# Conclusion

Summarize what you learned here

I learned 'cmd' is the way programmers command operating systems, icons are the way computer users navigate File Explorer, *right-click properties change* is the way downloaders and uploaders plan file transfers, *right-click properties change* is the way information technology supporters change extensions, *right-click properties change* is the way computer users select programs, Vectr is the tool web designers plan contrasting colors within a graphic design for a website's reader-audience, and *right-click properties change* is the way professionals share file sizes.
