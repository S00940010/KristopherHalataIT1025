I will know how to cite: internet architecture in terms of web clients, Internet Protocol and IP addresses, TCPs, IPv4, IPv6, cyber security, hackers, internet security, web browser security, system security, Internet Security Settings resources, website programs, URLs, domain names, and file paths (Unit 6).

# Internet Architecture

## Internet Protocol
* What is an IP address and what is the difference between IPv4 and IPv6? 

IP address is an Internet Protocol address. Servers send packets to IP addresses. The IPv4 started with 32 bits and IPv6 started with 128 bits. IPv4 and IPv6 are different. (http://www.steves-internet-guide.com/ipv6-guide/).

* Find the IP address of your computer by typing ipconfig at the command prompt (refer to the "Operating Systems" module for details.) 
  Take a screenshot of the command without including the IP address to show your success, name the file ipconfig and upload to the lab folder on GitHub. 
  
Please see uploads. 
  
* What is ICANN and how do they contribute to the global Internet? 

ICANN is Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers. Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers assigns network devices names and numbers. Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers assigns devices Internet Protocol (IP) addresses and Domain Name System (DNS). ICANN contributes addresses to the global Internet  (Internet Protocol).

## TCP/IP

#### Review the first article and answer these questions:
* What is the responsibility of TCP/IP? 

TCP/IP is a Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol. Transmission Control Protocol / Internet Protocol step by step receive and send network data between network adapters, hubs, switches, routers, and other network communications hardware. Transmission Control Protocol / Internet Protocol connects the client-server model. TCP/IP is responsible for those things addressed (Basics to TCP/IP Protocol).

* Explain how the client-server model applies to TCP/IP. 

The client-server model is shared communications. Transmission Control Protocol / Internet Protocol is the way clients and servers process shared communications (Basics to TCP/IP Protocol).

#### Review the second article and answer these questions:
Review the section of the article aligning the post office with protocol stacks.  
* Why are layers important to changing technology? 

Layers are component system definitions. There are Application, Transport, Networking, Data link, and Physical component systems. Layers simplify changing technologies. Layers are important to changing technology (The TCP/IP Model and Protocol Suite Explained).  

* What types of applications run on the "application" layer?

The Application layer runs: HTTP, POP3, IMAP4, SMTP, and TCP (The TCP/IP Model and Protocol Suite Explained).

# Internet Security
#### Watch the video and answer these questions:
* What is HTTP and how does it support the client-server model?

HTTP is a Hypertext Transfer Protocol. Hypertext Transfer Protocol supports clients' web server content. Hypertext Transfer Protocol retrieves the web page packet from the web server and sends it to clients. HTTP supports the client-server model (HTTP, HTTPS, SSL / TLS Explained).

* Explain the protocols that secure HTTPS uses to protect data.  

HTTPS is a Secure Hypertext Transfer Protocol and not the same as Hypertext Transfer Protocol. Secure Hypertext Transfer Protocol's encryptions secure data with ciphers. Secure Hypertext Transfer Protocol informs user with padlock icons.

SSL is a Secure Sockets Layer. Secure Sockets Layer verifies the entire client-server network connection. Secure Sockets Layer sends data as ciphers.

TLS is Transport Layer Security, not Secure Sockets Layer. Transport Layer Security verification is faster than Secure Sockets Layer. Transport Layer Security sends stronger ciphers than Secure Sockets Layer.


#### Review the following article: Securing Your Web Browser 
* Why should you secure your browser? 

Hackers infect computers. Secure web browsers disable hackers. Hackers send viruses through web browsers. Secure your browser.

* Explain one of the risks described in the article. 

The risk of a hacker hacking personal information increased in many computers computing as Administrators. They saw many computers did not become hacked if they were computing as other users. They concluded hackers hacked Administrator Mode's insecure protocols.

# Internet Programming

* Upload screenshots of your html, CSS, and result

Answer these questions
* Who was Tim Berners-Lee and why did he create the W3C? 

Tim Berners-Lee invented The Worldwide Web. W3C is The Worldwide Web Consortium. Tim Berners-Lee leads The Worldwide Web with The Worldwide Web Consortium. The Worldwide Web Consortium wrote in W3C.org/mission, Tim wants to lead The Web to its full potential by making the social value of The Worldwide Web available to all people, guide The Worldwide Web's development, and connect all people in communication, commerce, and knowledge (W3C.org/Mission).

* Pick a "standard" of your choice and explain why it is important. 

I choose standard principle A Web of Trust. The Worldwide Web needs trust to simplify commercial trade. Without trust, The Worldwide Web would not trade. Commercial trade is important for taxation (W3C.org/mission).

* Explain how XML differs from HTML. 

XML is Extensible Markup Language and shares data with others messages. HTML is Hypertext Markup Language and changes website appearances. XML differs from HTML.

# URLs and File Paths
* Match the following terms / definitions under the heading and explain how they are related by providing an example of all the pieces of a URL: 

Terms (Understanding a URL):

https = scheme
www.amazon.com = domain
. Edu = top level domain
no file path provided = default page
result of search = parameters
specific location on a page = anchor 

* What is your understanding of difference between Absolute and Relative File Paths. What would you use in your website? Why?

Absolute path is a complete URL address for a website domain or domain and webpage. Relative file path is a section of URL address for a webpage without a website domain. Both absolute and relative file paths are important. My websites would be complete with absolute and relative file paths because I could have visitors visit multiple pages (Absolute vs. Relative Paths).

* Explain the purpose and use of file compression.

File compression minimizes storage size. Hardware storage opens file space with file compression. The purpose is to offer more storage space with similar hardware.The purpose of file compression is use less hardware storage (What is a zip file?).

# Conclusion
I knew that technology evolves quickly, HTTP is a web server protocol, certificates are from web servers, cybercrime exists. 
I now know how to discuss Internet topics, networking software, Internet architecture with a client-server model, Internet Protocol, IP addresses; IPv4 addresses and IPv6 addresses, the main problem with IP addresses today, unique IP addresses, IPv6's extra IP addresses, our global IP address shortage, how IP configuration locates our own IP addresses, the ICANN organization, IIANA, Transmission Control Protocol and Internet Protocol, the steps Network Hardware and Communications Hardware process client-servers, Client-server Transmission Control Protocol and Internet Protocol as necessary for two clients to interact, website security, the importance of only one Internet and layers, constants of the layers of a few Network protocols such as Applications, Transport, Networking, Data link and Physical components, HTTP as an unsecured web server and is sending packets to and from hackers, more secure web servers are: HTTPS which encrypt data, SSL or Secure Sockets Layer securities that are sending certificates and encrypting data, Transport Layer Securities that are sending certificates and receiving certificates, trustworthy sites exist, Secure Sockets Layers and Transport Layer Security systems of web servers, client-server TCP and IP addresses, my browser and hackers, URLs in file pathing, Absolute and Relative file paths, Standards of The Worldwide Web Consortium, the worth of cyber security, XML and HTML differ in end-result, IBM's influence in XML and HTML is SGML, how to code my personal website, and how to compress files. I, with Professor Manjula in video, snipped and uploaded screenshots of: HTML, CSS, and their results.
