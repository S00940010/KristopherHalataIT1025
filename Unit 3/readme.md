Executive Summary
•	Write up as though you are explaining this week's lab to others.

•	Information technology licenses many software types. I started off reading examples of operating systems, and valuable, digitally downloaded user software, and their agreements, organization-wide software types, then remote and virtual server software comparisons. After, Professor Manjula challenged me to write Python codes, which today are available from open-sources and in many ways is risky! My participation, education, career, and plan come out from this course chapter as I involve myself to thrive as myself.

Software
•	Explain the roles of application, utility, and operating system software. Give an example of each.

The roles of application, utility, and operating system software are described to us as: performing specific tasks, fixing or modifying computers to fill shortcomings in operating system software, and managing hardware and creating the interface between the hardware and the user managing the hardware resources of the computer such as application writing software, respectively, word processing calculating, spreadsheets, surfing the net, then anti-malware, IDE programming, then Microsoft Windows, Apple’s Mac iOS, Linux, iOS, Android, Windows Mobile, and Blackberry were examples. My examples of application, utility, and operating system software are mobile G.P.S. travel guides, Wi-Fi connections, and Windows 10 software, separately. We must use these to access most applications.

•	Explain the purpose of ERP software and provide an example.

The purpose of ERP software, explained to us as Enterprise Resource Planning software, was intended to assist each of departments who produce computed goods and services for consumers simultaneously within an organization as one unit and is exemplified being like SAP, Oracle, and Microsoft. I with TTEC used SAP during human resources activities, Oracle for resource databases, Microsoft user accounts for computer usage, and Salesforce for Customer Relationship Management, in which there are cases organized by customer and database categories. The reasons were for efficient customer services corresponding with phone call issues. Salesforce automatically posits customer and case data as the phone rings. During the phone call manipulation of data occurs and notes are recorded. Post-call, more information is recorded, and descriptions are filed. You might recognize ERP as Tri-C email software, Blackboard software, or career connect software. We as a class will recognize Blackboard as ERP software. A forum-style shared software intended to grade assignments and communicate. Teams might be an ERP with intensions to communicate in real time throughout the class. Governmental departments must share resources and without security will compromise documentation and can be maintain homeland security now that files can be shared within a circle of users and government machines.

•	Explain the purpose of virtualization and describe how it differs from cloud computing.

The purposes of virtualization and cloud computing might differ because virtualization is utilized as a visual representation of hardware. Cloud computing provides services through the internet. I can play my Super Nintendo Entertainment System, virtually, with online Virtual Machine downloads. You as a professor will download Virtual Machines sometimes, try Smart Board. We as citizens of this nation must use Virtual Machines if the law required us to use an Apple Mac iOS and we hold a PC and Windows. If it is the only way to conduct business, then we should! Virtualizations are fake machines and their goal is operating a visual, downloaded, digital, virtual version if a brick and mortar machine is not our first choice. My one-word explanation is “substitute.”

Python
•	Follow the tasks for python coding. Then upload screenshot of python code (named Python) and output to this folder, Unit 3
Virtualization
•	What types of problems are solved with virtualization?
The main benefit is hardware savings. Hardware to virtualization has been described as cash is to stock markets - virtual. Virtualization is created so we can compute without hardware! A thank you as balance sheets are left without capital losses, a result of hardware depreciation. Virtualization also requires no more floor space and less hours and minutes initializing than a physical server, network, or desktop. Digital credentials and updates cost, not CD-ROMs, their weeks in the mail system, piracy, and black-market sales. Three types of virtualization, server, network, and desktop make time to production faster:

 Server virtualization runs multiple operating systems on one. As a list, virtual servers reduce IT costs, reduce operating costs, create workload deployment, create application performance, create server availability, reduce server sprawl and complexity. 

Network virtualization replaces physical network architecture. Virtual networks create operational benefits, reduce logical ports, switches, routers, firewalls, load balancers, VPNs and more – and they are all connected. 

Desktop virtualization replaces desktops and applications and deliver them to branch offices. Virtual desktops help IT support. Virtual desktops are emailed reducing operating costs of outsourcing without compromising stakeholder equity.

•	What role does hypervisor play in virtualization?
•	Software termed hypervisors virtualize hardware for power. The role hypervisors play in enterprises is like describing why my mom chose to eat her favorite food – they are at the helm; I will come back later. Hypervisor is a word with two parts, hyper and visor – hyper, beyond and visor, protector. We will assume hypervisor implies beyond reach with hands and protector of operating expenses. The easiest description of hypervisor costs is in the vein of hardware computers, networks, and servers. Hypervisors split energy just like cow utters. Partitions of milk through numerous utters explain hypervisors. Virtual servers, networks, and desktops require processing ability, or milk. Among computer’s electronic hardware are circuits and signals, they split processing power into a number of virtual hardware.
•	
You will be deceived if the hardware is owned by its licensor, purchaser, et al., and the program is leased to you absent of actual hardware and not materially the user’s, you! We must be careful to read agreements. When the use is over, and it will end, we can easily accept that impression.


Career Exploration
Career Exploration
•	Tri-C College Central:
•	Register for a student account.
•	Use one of the search options such as "Search - Intern Central," take a screenshot of the listings (include your name in the upper right-hand corner in your screenshot,) name the file: CollegeCentral and upload to your lab folder.
Bureau of Labor Statistics
•	Go to: Bureau of Labor Statistics website and continue exploring careers in IT (or your area of interest.) You can search for "web developer" or "network" or "cyber" and see what jobs appear. Report your findings including job title, salary, and projected growth. You can upload a screenshot if you want.
Industry Certification
•	Explore a certification and report your findings. (CompTIA, Cisco, CISSP or any other certification)

Report of CompTIA.org 
Their Cybersecurity Analyst (CySA+) certification advertises itself teaching those who want to analyze, prepare, and protect online crime victims. I read a list of five skillsets to learn and they are: threat and vulnerability management, software and systems security, compliance and assessment, security operations and monitoring, and incident response. These skills are musts for security analyst, threat intelligence analyst, security engineer, application security analyst, incident response or handler, compliance analyst, and threat hunter. They teach threat detection skills, data analysis, and critical thinking skills so you must interpret the results to identify vulnerabilities, threats, and risks to an organization, with the end goal of securing and protecting applications and systems within an organization. 
College Certificates
•	Explore the Tri-C certificates at: Tri-C IT Programs and report on a certificate of interest (short-term or post-degree.)
I chose the IT Support Professional, Certificate of Proficiency because it is general. Its description reads, “Students will be prepared with the knowledge and skills essential for a career as an entry-level service technician. They will be prepared to service computers and peripherals by discovering how to install, configure, diagnose, repair, upgrade and maintain microcomputers. Skills acquired will assist students in preparing to take industry A+ Certification exams. A+ Certification is an industry recognized credential that distinguishes one as a knowledgeable service professional.”
Upgrade and maintenance of microcomputers appeals to me.
Who is cut out for IT Supporting? We all are. Beginning at the education – a new indication from the numerous examples of IT preparedness is the “practice, then knowledgeability” school. Supportive as college is, free certifications do not exist, which in these years have demonstrated among us how much confidence and interest are vital to develop a network and social collaboration without coursework. Like this, we will emerge prepared. Without individual care, our educations might be forgone. The IT Support Profession, Certificate of Proficiency proves to employers the candidate is striving to be among enthusiastic fellows of Information Technology! 
•	Explain what you need to do to become co-op "ready" and the benefits of pursuing a co-op or internship
1.	Participate in the co-op orientation process through the Career Center, 
2.	Upload your resume for final revisions and approval by a Career Coach at College Central Network
3.	Work with an Employer Relations Specialist to apply and interview with approved co-op placements 
4.	Complete and sign a "Cooperative Education Agreement" form and register for college credit
Co-ops and internships are bold statements. Preparedness is hard proven. More, they might secure you magnificent entry-level positions, after probing questions. So when metrics of college report cards meet requirements and when recommended internships and co-ops have hired, then there are less rules new hiring managers must go from, given previous co-op and internship recommendations, to take you into their private sector. The glow of your soft skills, however ambiguous, governs a path and that is refuted if self-testified, this fact cannot be changed. So else we find fortitude in recommendations and escape financial ruin, or even though so, each oneself turns into a likable example that soars some other way, I am presenting and pressing for my rule that co-ops and internships are required and have gotten more serious since 40% of high school graduates are attending a college, twice that of 20% that high school graduates of our 1900s attended.
Professional Membership
•	Pick one of the IT organizations like IEEE or ACM or a student club and report the purpose of the organization and why membership would be beneficial.
Invention happens as laws permit; IEEE seeks innovation with lawfulness as its aim. In capitalistic organizations, work as Information Technologists and Market Researchers became even more important after household personal computer sales. From 2016 to 2018, six-thousand, one-hundred, and forty mobile applications were released through the Google Play store every day. The law of averages states that odds decrease as outputs increase. So do not depend on logic and abilities to sell, depend on market research. Computer programs are available as consumer commodities and tools. The latter, rather than the previous, returns, and does not distract, but strengthens and has revenue as its aim. And because I am happy to do it, IEEE and ACM are both excellent choices for market research!
Conclusion
•	Summary of your understanding from this week's lab
Computation power is not fully utilized in many systems. As a serpent waits for the meal of the month, the serpent could hunt for additional meals. However, the hunter-human hunts for multiple meals at once collecting a week’s worth of food in one successful hunt. Bloody as it may be, it is worth the hunter’s efforts to care for the family he supports, in hunting, other than hunting while the food is stored for eating later. The computer similarly has computation power unutilized, like the serpent waits for hunger to power a hunt, until the corral of virtual machines stores output from that computation power that is now being utilized. Similarly, they have enough to eat, with more effort, now necessary functions satisfied are expected.

A car battery is not utilized completely with each use. Driving a car allocates battery and similar to computers allocates cars battery to make use of each cell completely and lawfully. Each battery cell must gain potential a great gain to the company using its computer as virtual hardware. Done before, virtual hardware is preferred, and virtualization was commonplace at the year 2008.
