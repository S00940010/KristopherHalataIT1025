# Executive Summary
Explain the goal for this lab

* Lab 5 is great. This continues practicing GitHub uploads, flowcharts, internet vocabulary, hardware communications, modern trends, and business preferences. For me it is written to serve customers, including non-paying others, with their networking trouble. Goals should be serving others because broadband is a basic human right. The way some people treat others with less money is reprehensible. Complex networks decide for themselves, to some people, with a mind of their own. I as a networking student must like to connect us, I remember my dad suggested networking for me.

# LucidChart

Create a new blank diagram (ignore message boxes to upgrade) and create a flowchart for a computer program that
asks for a number and then
* prints "Big" if the number is greater than 10
* prints "Small" if the number is less than 10.
Use the following resource (or one of your choice) as a guide: https://www.tutorialspoint.com/programming_methodologies/programming_methodologies_flowchart_elements.htm Add a textbox to the chart with your name

Download your chart as a jpg file and name it: DecisionFlowchart and upload the file to your GitHub lab folder

Share your experience using Lucidchart in a paragraph (3-4 lines)

* To the right of the Repl.it code box is a debugger. Code is very exciting. For it is written in code, it becomes illustrative. Without code, computers may not have taken over my tedious work. For freedom of thought, code simplifies user inputting. One paragraph at a time. A paragraph of thought at once explains a child scripting SCAR RuneScape bot, in a fit manually collected 1,000 in-game yew logs at the price of 250,000 gold pieces. In one sitting I taught a computer to use logic. I like the illustration of Lucidchart, if it is written for human success, I will use it. Using Python to menially simplify another being's input will have saved their input time. Experience says conscious self makes biased decisions for oneself. Your question is taking my time. Share with us your advanced possibilities of Lucidchart!?

# Networking
## Intro to Networking
Data Transmission

* Dial-up tied up the phone line and Broadband is a basic human right.

Match the following words with their definitions 

Words:
Packet: Unit of data
Packet-Switching: Technology that allows packets of data to be routed based on destination address
IP Address: Unique identifying number
DNS: Directory of IP address common names. (For example, 54.239.26.214 might be the IP address of amazon.com)
Protocol: Set of rules to allow devices to communicate

Definitions to match:
Protocol: Set of rules to allow devices to communicate
Packet: Unit of data
IP Address: Unique identifying number
Packet-Switching: Technology that allows packets of data to be routed based on destination address
DNS: Directory of IP address common names. (For example, 54.239.26.214 might be the IP address of amazon.com)

## Network Hardware
* Explain the benefit of a switch over a hub.

Switches work with hubs over time. A hub transmits data packets centrally, to all devices. A central hub cannot control switches. Switches over hubs manage who receives packets. Switches are *two-way* transmitting devices, capable of limiting ports. Data packets can be kept or sent *one device to one device*. A manager possibly protects data using switches. Of course, you wonder which is better? One benefit of switches is control. One benefit of hubs is community. I think 3 real-life implications of hubs: a new company is sharing data between 3 persons. Let me say more about that, as company levels increase, I think communal hub use decreases singularly. I think each person increases data security risk. I sometimes think hubs support single people with many devices. I think complexities in business are scientifically tested. I think complex ideas, I thought of multiple benefits. I think situations of a network warrant switching from one hardware to another. I think explaining one altruistic benefit is doomed incorrect. I hear switches brag about purposefully connecting two devices. I hear hubs brag about simple administrative architectures. I know networks benefit about both switches and hubs. And I heard they are being replaced!

* Explain the benefit of a router over hubs and switches.

Routers and hubs and switches are teammates. Switches know how to stop talking, I think switches stop packets. And I think switches and hubs are similar, last question they were different. I think hubs enable intranet transmissions from extranet access. I think switches disable intranet transmissions. Over the internet, routers are assigned an IP address. A router brags internet access. Of course, each router connects each other. Benefits of routers exceed hubs and switches. The benefit of a router is internet access. Complex as a router is the business employment of hubs and switches. Hubs = intranet transmissions. Switches = intranet security. Routers = internet.

## Network Topology
* Explain: Single point of failure and the topologies that experience this issue.

Let me begin in jest, I laughed because those topology jokes are funny. Issues badly impact entire networks restricting points. This so badly effects ring topologies. Experienced network architects pay extra. That ring topology is so bad for internet communications. Topologies of "shared downtime" are ring and star if hubs become more point-to-multipoint they improve resiliency. Mesh topologies maximally share transmission points. The bus topologies minimalize transmission points. And because bus topologies are wired, wireless topologies replace bus topologies with least effort. Failure encourages innovation. Of all the topologies I think ad hoc is least materialistic. Points of transmission increases trouble risk. Single devices of transmission include router and cellular devices. Two topologies minimalize hardware, ad hoc and wireless mesh. I think you can find us using infrastructure topologies at Tri-C. Complexities I think matter are low-income installation, ad hoc speeds, wireless security.

* Compare the Infrastructure Topology and Wireless Mesh. Which do you think is better and why?

Questions: should this two-dimensional question be answered in one statement? Why will that be a mistake? And better yet, why does answering a simple question in depth cancel robotic repetition? Better is it to extrapolate than simplify. Is language best explained looking at one word, or multiple words? Think about the sentences than sound lazy, "The red fox jumped over the lazy brown dog." You learn a fox is red, a dog is brown, and foxes can jump on, or over dogs. Do dogs seem lazy? Which method is wired then wireless, "Infrastructure is wired" and "Wireless Mesh is wireless‚Äù? Topologies connect devices and networks, so which is connecting devices to devices and which is connecting networks? Mesh is a word for maximum transmission points, I think mesh screens shaped "########". Wireless Mesh is a multiple device overlapping points of transmission for connecting five or more devices together. A point of transmission is an exchange of packets. Mesh structured devices share packets directly between and along transmissions across all devices. And that is almost my favorite. Topology can use routers and mesh radios spreading, extending the area router devices transmit wireless internet waves. Infrastructure router restarts are annoying and ad hoc, my favorite service, is usually software. The ad hoc is less hardware and neither are compared so I used ad hoc, if a common ground baseline compares, then a standard measures them. Comparisons of Infrastructure and Wireless Mesh transmissions: Mesh requires scattered mesh nodes, internet and extranet transmissions increase range, frequency, not speed, and Infrastructure LAN switches with devices through a common wired LAN transmit with devices for intranet speed, frequency, not range, extranet frequency, not speed nor range, and internet frequency, speed, and not range.

# Cybersecurity and Encryption

* Imagine you are part of the Amazon.com online chat. Explain how each component of the security triad would impact your job

Jobs do not tell you all there is to know. Your questions need a topology. Impactful are viruses. Would a hub spread a virus? Triads define threats, can a switch prevent spreading? If security defends, then I should not defend. The job I have does not rely upon security. Of principle then, edit network settings if the job allows, Amazon.com chatters do not, chatters write customers. Components share transmissions. Each Amazon.com network administrator impacts chatters' job. How I loathed network administrators with TTEC. Explaining I enabled a hub network bridge to chat managers renders confusion. 

If security is not my job, then each component does not impact my job. Chat does do internet communicating, chat learns their scripts and database. Online tools: biometrics, authentication, internet devices, extranet chats, intranet private messages, encryptions, and all communications, support chat. Amazon commerce exchanges currency and thus financial incentive economizes how Amazon.com defends itself. Every device multiplies how many devices join the network transmissions and could point entire initiatives where to access classified files. The point was network security is not chat's job. Of all the jobs, if security administrators are unqualified, leadership deserves to know now. Part of the job description, has been said, is avoiding others. Are chatters last to be experimenting with security protocol? You decide. Imagine a chatter opens all ports. I wish for chatters to learn security protocol, then it will become clear as to why risking classified files if they edit settings is really for Networkers. 

The Security Triad: Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability.

* Identify three daily tasks that require authentication. Explain how each one could be converted to multi-factor authentication

Each of three tasks that require authentication could preserve confidentiality, integrity, and availability are assigned: physical keys, accounts payable wage/salary computers, electronics user accounts.

Authentication is the process of identifying someone and securely. Multiple factors could include biological, knowledgeable, and tangible inputs. To have failed any one factor will decline its match and access. Factors have been bypassed illegally so converted single factors have been objectively converted not only to prevent any recurrence of the failure related to an accident, but to the extent possible to reduce other risks in future securities. Multi-factor fully recognizes that the risk associated with transmitting networks cannot be eliminated. There could be no more fitting upgrade to the confidentiality, integrity, and availability to do so. Authentication would be attributed as becoming many more things, could your question call for "as many examples as you can think of"? 

Required by a company are the payroll department for accounting, the building for safety, and co-workers want identification for quality control. Payroll could have fingerprint/biometric clock-in/out for accurate time clock values. The building could have locks for security and badge verification for deactivated keys. The team could have picture and name identification for each other to recall their co-workers/teammates.

* Explain ACL and RBAC. What are the advantages and disadvantages of each?

What is ACL and RBAC? A is Access. AC is Access Control. ACL is Access Control List. R is role. B is based. A is access. C is control. Why is A access? Why is C control? Why is An Access and C Control? Why is AC Access Control the control of access? Why are ACL and RBAC Access Controls? Some users are higher risk than other users and Access Control limited their access, it worked, Access Control limits users. Users have no control of how much content they are allowed, or keenly authorized, viewing in the workspace. Access Control, in any form, it is postulated, limits, for a third time, the Access users have over Controlling company content. 

Now two separate forms, L is List and RB is Role-based, exist. This paragraph will cover those differences. Databases denote lists. Some users are categorized as 'not authorized to know'. Another user is always resetting the list. As new members come in, they could be sent to the 'not authorized to know' list. Then more users and more and more andmoreandmoreandmore AND MORE ANDMOREANDMORE then the security administrator is so full of users that bytes exceed manageable amounts. RB is role-based. L is list. RB replaced L. Role-based replaced list. Roles equal names. Roles are job titles, categories. Multiple names each could role equally. So, role-based access control is categorized. Names are programmed. Role-based = variables. Names are variables. Variables suggest roles. The role lists access control. Role-based Access Control saves time and memory.

* Explain the interaction of ciphertext, a public key and a private key

Keys are secret encrypted messages. Private keys are messages for a recipient only. A food has ingredients and once upon a time, you could invent a cake. And long gone are those days of inventing cake, cakes have many ingredients and a machine would be programmed successfully for extracting chemicals as a list and may have been if ingredients are databased, hardware can extract chemical compounds, software can interpret data, memory can be securely stored, and data can be securely transmitted. Keys change by a few decisions. Public as they are, decisions that do not require transmissions could be transmitted publicly, for safety it is ill-advised. A magic moment for hackers. 

In this paragraph I will explain your meaning of ciphertext. Ciphertext is apparently a secret, until someone such as "Eve" in the video, or a criminal, or a bad man, or a bad woman, or a bad child, or a bad robot access. Only few should know how your message can be accessed. I think interactions could be safer with total encryption always. For example, the password in chat rooms. Explaining the public key and a private key interaction is like computing without transmissions, transmissions cannot get out nor in, so transmissions will not transmit.   

* Explain why we need public key cryptography.

Case in point, "in cipher or by character of any sort other than ordinary written language" (Perkins v. Nationwide Life Ins. Co., 41 Ohio St. 2d 213 - Ohio: Supreme Court 1975), ciphers secure sent writings. Cryptography has 2 main parts, crypt = hidden and ‚Äòography = study. Keys are valuable. Keys very purpose is protecting value. Public keys are economically misused because resources are scarce. "Appellant lodges numerous instances of misfeasance on the part of defendants in using public goods and services for private gain" (State ex rel. Waite v. Berry, 11 Ohio St. 3d 53 - Ohio: Supreme Court 1984). Need for public goods is psychologically misused because the way we think drives our behaviors. We see dishonest computing constantly in video games, "Theft of virtual items in online multiplayer computer games: an ontological and moral analysis" (Litska Strikwerda). Why we need public key cryptography is made clear in "Health Services Research in The Privacy Age" (Rachel Hess, et al.), "To create a data collection system that would facilitate and fulfill obligations to protect privacy." Explaining why research is. Thank you.

## Cryptography
* Type a message in the "Caesar Cipher Exploration box and turn the wheel to encrypt your message.
Then explain the encryption here:

Is the purpose to omit the selected letter? I should not tell you my message. Here is my "dad's" joke, it is my secret message. I say: "Yellow!" He says: "Owe!" Joke: "yellow owe". If I encode K, my message became "iovvyg ygob", else if I turned the wheel to M, then it became "kqxxai aiqd". 

* Type a message in the "Frequency Fingerprint Exploration" box and a) Explain the result.

Frequency distribution of English symbols. If I type 50 times, then its frequency bar raised 50 intervals upward, offscreen.

b) Would it be different for different languages?

Frequencies of registered symbols count. I think symbols differ as variably as languages.

* What is a "Polyalphabetic cipher?"

Addition and subtraction.

Type a message in the "Polyalphabetic Exploration" box as well as a shift word.

message: hi
shift word: bye
polyalphabetic encryption: jh
polyalphabetic decryption: fj

Explain the result.

Message encryption rules: 

Summation of each n=1 through i=2, [n + i'th k]
First letter and every third (+2=+b, b.y.e.) letters 
Adds each letter corresponding to each shift word letter, up to k letters (letters in 'hi' = k = 2)
Answer: h1 + b1, i1 + y1 = j , h

Message decryption rules:

Subtraction of each n=1 through i=2, [n - i'th k]
First letter and every third (-2=-b, etc. b.y.e.) letters 
Subtracts each letter corresponding to each value and position, up to k letters (letters in 'hi' = k = 2)
Answer: h1 - b1, i1 - y1 = f , j 

## Brute Force
* What is Brute-Force and how does it relate to Kerckhoffs's principle?

What is Brute-Force? A principle in breaking codes is trial and error. If Kerckhoff's principle wants everyone to know the cipher, then not know how to break it, Brute-Force could not ever solve a cipher. To Kerckhoff, time is irrelevant. Relating to the scientific method Kerckhoff's principle is perfection. It means we cannot break a cipher created with intellectual boundaries because dying would happen first. Does that make sense? How could someone prove a cipher could never be broken? And how could a coder produce it? And reverse, how could ciphers never break it? Brute-Force could spend time. Brute-Force could innovate machines. Is a machine, that is new and never reproduced validating Kerckhoff's principle? What is possible?

# Conclusion
Summarize how this lab was useful to you and what you learnt that really interested you!

Ciphers! You have taught me many topics. Interested as I am, ciphers relate with Babbage's Engine #2. Really, Babbage's Engine #2 is for difference calculations. That means quotients too. Learnt is frequency distributions, What Are Information Systems? Chapter 1. You related the frequency distributions as Hardware and Data Representation, Chapter 2. What about cipher generators, Software, Chapter 3? And Chapter 4, Data and Databases, common file formats and Commands. You used Chapter 5, Networking and Communication. To Chapter 6, Information Systems Security, ciphers relate directly. Ciphers are Security Systems securing Information. Useful as programs are, ciphers secure them.

English: Was lab one, two, three, four, five as easy for you as for me?

Lab 5 taught me about what it could cost running an insurance and risk management firm. This course could be my favorite. How would a store online selling hardware goods customer secure data? I also learned risks teach all of us.
