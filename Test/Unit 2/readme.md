# Chapter 2: Hardware

# Executive Summary

Hardware is the central component, at the time of Charles Babbage, in each machine of ours to prepare ourselves to serve our world with IEEE. In their circuitry signals, electrical energy, we are asked to find out what our electrical engineers put together, with our computer scientists’, their numeric notation software logic gates, computers. In the end, we will be the students who recognize and manipulate hardware designed with speed and durability in memory and answer them during malfunction, their inevitable crash.

# Hardware

## Hard Drives and Memory

* What is the difference between latency and transfer rates in the performance of a hard drive?

Space, transfer rate of bits, their motion of transmissions in computer circuitry exists clocked at time in milliseconds, latency. Hard drive performance, space per time, transfer rate per latency, bits per millisecond measures speed. Space per time per space measures time until the file transfer is completed, bits per millisecond per bitstotal measured at such milliseconds.

* How a solid state (SSD) hard drive is different from a traditional hard drive?

Hard drives save long term memory. A solid-state drive and traditional hard drive differ in designs with our motherboard; however, our solid-state drives do not move, reducing space and time. Solid-state drive space and time decreased with traditional hard drive usage. Unlike a solid-state drive a traditional hard drive needs head and disk motions and seek and rotational times. 


* Why does increasing RAM make the computer run faster?

Circuitry as currents measure at milliseconds. A substitute, hard drive, stores memory at bits without regarding recall. In each computation input on the way to our output, transmissions encode to RAM and hard drive in bits. RAM stores short-term memory. RAM is so fast because it prepares computers to answer questions when asked and RAM already knows which answer so where is irrelevant while wondering when. Simply, computer speeds increase because RAM is prepared to answer. RAM forgets that data at Power Off.

* What is the difference between 64 and 32 bit data paths?

Data paths of computers is the circuitry, like our circulatory system, that cycles data throughout them. We are reminded in Hardware that first, 64- and 32-bit data paths differ in space data motion fills. Second, we are reminded that 64- and 32-bit data paths differ in time for all data to transfer to circuitry involved for computations. In motion, one cycle transferred 32 less bits than 64 bits per cycle. At 32-bits less per cycle, milliseconds doubled! 

## ALU and Control Unit

* Explain the interaction of the control unit and ALU in the CPU

Using electricity, the computation processing unit unites binary codes in arithmetic logic units that add, multiply, subtract, and divide constants using registers, addresses, and instructions with control units that execute registers, addresses, and instructions systematically. Readily, the computing users input each data transmission command via flags and send and receive data set forth by the RAM and hard drive memory components.

## CPU, Input and Output

* Identify how the example addresses each of the components: CPU, Input and Output

In the example, computers require CPU and Input and Output (our representation of computation signals) to perform basic functions for us. Those calculations and numbers computers save for us are not useful unless turned into relevant problems that are sent away from computation components such as arithmetic logic unit toward those components receiving them such as control units whose insides are bearing flags around their circuitry and logically computing them with mathematics functions for us to submit as calculated. Without computers, forgetting those calculations would be easy. A shortage of calculations would destroy businesses and industries. Without computers, employees would struggle to complete assignments on time and exchange ink pens for new pens and paper most often. Genuine inputs and output relativity is needed, as they are translations circuitry becomes through CPU and incapable of computing alone.

## Logic Gates and circuits

* Explain what is meant by a truth table and apply your knowledge to a NAND gate.

Within a truth table, mathematical functions calculate outputs for us. NAND demands an output of 1 if input answer is 0. Calculation NAND requires an equation  =abs(A*B). Given (0,0) 0*1=0. If fact any value abs(A*B) =0 is output positive 1, then all input values with one value 0 = 0. Then, any input value 0 equals output value 1. Keep reading the only output 0 is a double affirmative, 0-less (1,1). Keeping the same rules each input effects the whole output. The rule is meant to variably instruct numbers. These are instructions executing constants.

* How does the NAND gate truth table compare to that of an AND gate?

Computers have logic gates and truth tables. A NAND gate affirms inputs bearing 0. An AND gate affirms affirms inputs bearing no 0. All logic gates can be explained simply. Comparatively, they are opposites. What are they if not separate logic gate rulers pleading in computer circuitry language to “perform”!

## IEEE - Ethically Aligned Design

* Explain the purpose of IEEE and the importance of ethics in device design

I hope to join IEEE, so that out of information technology my ethical basis might strengthen our Laws, provide for the consumers of our business, and innovate continually as brilliant technologists worldwide.

# Data Representation

## Numeric Conversions

* Explain the difference between decimal, binary and hexadecimal numbers

Introspectively, numbers are the most basic element of Mathematics. Decimally 0-9 (10 as base) count infinitely by 1. These numbers are Mathematics’ basic language. 

### DECIMAL
_128_ + _64_  +  _32_  +  _16_  +  _8_  +  _4_  +  _2_  + _1_  = 256

The decimal numbers are translated into binary numbers (2 as base) describing data space. Translating computer data for us, binary notation incorporates 8 bytes, up to 8 digits! The greatest addends incorporating a sum define binary numbers. 

### BINARY
1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1-1=0 	= 256-1=255

Intelligently, Algebra introduced to us expressions. Hexadecimal numbers (16 as base) involve one letter for each double-digit number 10-15, individually, A=10, B=11, C=12, D=13, E=14, F=15. To maintain user friendliness, hexadecimals notation interprets binary values, at less digits!

### HEXADECIMAL
_8_ _4_ _2_ _1_ = 15 = F
_1_ _1_ _1_ _1_ = 15 = F

* Convert the decimal number 211 to binary showing your work (be sure to include your name in your screenshot or scanned file) and save to a file named DecimalConversion and upload to your lab folder.

128 + 64  +  32  +  16  +  8  +  4  +  2  + 1  = 256	  27       26      25        24     23     22     21    20       28
221- 128 = 93 – 64 = 29 – 16 = 13 – 8 = 5 – 4 = 1 -1 = 0
Greatest common decimal addends: 128, 64, 16, 8, 4, 1
221DEC = 11011101BIN

## Hexadecimal color representation

* Convert the binary representation: 10110101 to decimal and save your work to a file named BinaryConversion and upload to the lab folder.
128 + 64  +  32  +  16  +  8  +  4  +  2  + 1  = 256
10110101=128 + 32 + 16 + 4 + 1 = 181
Greatest common decimal addends: 128, 64, 16, 8, 4, 1
10110101BIN=181DEC

* Explain the representation: #ab00ff using the site: https://www.colorhexa.com/

Magenta, 100 Blue 67 Red 0 Green

### HEXADECIMAL ab00ff
### BINARY 10101011
### DECIMAL 171
128+32+8+2+1

* When considering accessibility in web sites would this color be problematic? Explain what should be considered.

The accessibility in websites always presents problems for readers. We are trained to read books. Why does coloration present a problem to some readers? Poor vision impedes those with low resolution, disabilities, small fonts, unstandardized fonts, and chromatic backgrounds. Now contrast was considered in our texts so I should consider contrast too.

# Conclusion

* Explain what you learnt from this lab

In this Lab Hardware, we were offered a chance to not reinvent, but to be understanding and self-confident in life's computer crashes, because when we come across impediments, our education taught us that solutions for hardware repair are in our hands. Thank you Professor Manjula for giving our hardware education to us. I learnt hardware processes, uses, notations, codes, logic, and history.
