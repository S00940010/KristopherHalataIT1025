# Executive Summary

I want to know how to define: Object oriented programming, how Data, Information, and Knowledge are different, Relational Data, the four V's of Big Data, Structured Query Language, DBMS, primary and foreign keys, codes of ethics, legal implications, and WIPO.


# Object Oriented Programming
* Create a class (using paper and pencil or using the Microsoft whiteboard app) for the following:

a) Phone

b) House

c) Employee

Partner Accountant, Partner Lawyer, Chief Statistician, Chief Data Analyst, Department Head Professor

* Identify the features (In the video for the Car class, we identified the properties as Year, Make, Model etc.)

* Identify the actions (In the video for the Car class, we identified the methods as Drive, Park, Start etc.)

* Then upload a screenshot of your diagram to GitHub for each of the above classes.


# Data, Information and Knowledge 
## Relational Data

* What is the difference between data, information, and knowledge? 

Data produces a new array. Contexts create new imagery. New learners acquired and verify new hypotheses. New researchers test, observe, record, and present new knowledge. New professionals accept new researchers and give wisdom.

Data is post-failure. Information is pre-success. Knowledge is finding which is it?

* If you were creating a database for a small company and two tables you identify are customers and orders explain the following:
(be sure to use the example in the chapter as a guide - customers and orders would be like clubs and events) 
a) What would be the primary key in the customers and orders table? 

A primary key is a unique identifier for each record in a table, in the customer and orders table, with only one relationship as their primary key, is it ID? If it were a real table, then I think customer ID and order ID is valid - minimize future tables and entries.

b) How would the customers and orders table be related? Relation is why.

People assigned a customer ID will have a meal in the restaurant, they will be databased order ID. 

c) What would be the foreign key in the orders table? 

A foreign key is unrelated data, in the orders table, with only one foreign key, is it order ID? If it were a real table, then I think customer ID relates to many more tables than order ID relates.
 
d) The orders table would likely have a date field.  Explain why it is important to properly define the data type of a field. 

 Customers experience meals at different times of hunger and visit the restaurant meeting different employees. Customer trends can suggest decisions should be made. Dates suggest employees and shipments deserve decisions made.  
 
 
## Big Data

* Briefly describe the four "Vs" of big data 

Big data is endowed with four "Vs" for defining itself and the world's databases and are because The Worldwide Web's centralization. 

They are: 

1. Volume, population growth; 2. velocity, internet usage; 3. variety, diverse interests; 4. veracity, data not information. 
 
* What types of technology have driven the increased need for big data? 

Big data is needed now more than ever. How big data influences us is driven by 4 types of technologies:

1.  Customers shop daily, scanners easily capture sales, data became big data because populations grew.

2.  Developers of relational enterprise packages can support big data's millions of bytes for pay as a solution.

3.  Developers of data warehouses compare metadata, now and later, drawing inferences - for the competitive edge. 

4.  Developers of data mining hypothesize for knowledge with claims and programs.

 
# Structured Query Language (SQL)
* Explain RDBMS and how it relates to SQL and the purpose of SQL 

DBMS is Relational Database Management Systems. Relational Database Management Systems are interfaced to view and change the design of a database, create queries, and develop reports with columns and rows and related data entries called tables. Database Management Systems and SQL develop and analyze database systems and read and write other formats. SQL is a Relational Database Management System.

* Pick two related tables from the diagram provided in the "module - SQL" and explain the relationship between them
Products and Suppliers. 

a) which is the primary key?

Product ID is absent from Table-Supplier because it is a primary key to itself. 

b) which is the foreign key?

Supplier ID is present with Table-Product because it is a foreign key to Product.

* Using W3Schools, try out a 
a) select statement 
a) where clause 
and upload screenshots of the results.
* Explain how SQL injections are a security threat and what can be done to reduce the issue. 
  
 Hackers make attempts at data with an SQL injection. Database owners might lose access to all usernames and passwords in a database. To prevent that and reduce attacks, the username and password become SQL parameters. Those parameters align data with username and password. SQL parameters disregard injections as '
 0'.
  
  
# Ethical and Legal Implications of Information Systems
## Code of Ethics
* Explain the purpose of a "code of ethics" and why the ACM created a code for the computing discipline.

A group, in any form, must have a code of ethics that describes what is acceptable and unacceptable behavior. ACM is the Association for Computing Machinery. ACM created a code of ethics for ensuring that computer systems enhance, not degrade, the quality of working life and professional behavior stays acceptable.  

* Explain the difference between a code of ethics and AUP (acceptable use policies.) 

Group members must follow Code of Ethics for acceptable relationships within the organization, as an example, honesty and integrity.

Group members must follow Acceptable Use Policies for access of the organization's equipment, as an example, students are prohibited from exchanging User IDs and Passwords because if practiced, qualifies as unacceptable and those students will lose their rights for use of institution computers and network. 


* Pick a site of your choice and read the AUP.  Select a policy of interest and report your findings (include a link to the site in your report.) 

http://www.mysite.com/fs_img/search/acceptable-use-guidelines.htm

Unlawful Purposes. You may not transmit, distribute, host or store material, or participate in any conduct, that may violate any applicable local, state, federal or foreign law or regulation. This includes, without limitation: material that exploits children under the age of 18.

Site viewers are encouraged to remain lawful by treating minors respectfully in accordance with many Codes of Ethics. Minor's personal information endangers them. A good code I think - keeping them from predators.


## Intellectual Property
* From the chapter follow the link to the WIPO.  What is the purpose and importance of the WIPO? 

 WIPO is World Intellectual Property Organization. The mission is "to lead the development of a balanced and effective international IP system that enables innovation and creativity for the benefit of all" (https://www.wipo.int/about-wipo/en/). We provide IP services that encourage individuals and businesses to innovate and create" (https://www.wipo.int/wipoproof/en/). "WIPO's organizational structure is based on seven Sectors, each headed by a Deputy Director General (DDG) or Assistant Director General (ADG), under the overall leadership of the Director General. Each Sector comprises several units, usually called Divisions or Departments, led by Directors. These are responsible for delivering the programs and activities approved by member states in the Program and Budget" (https://www.wipo.int/about-wipo/en/activities_by_unit/). "Finance is responsible for the processing and distribution of fees relating to all WIPO Services" (https://www.wipo.int/finance/en/). World Intellectual Property Organization
34, chemin des Colombettes, CH-1211 Geneva 20, Switzerland" (https://www3.wipo.int/contact/en/).
 
 
* Using links in the chapter explain how a copyright is obtained and the benefit of registering for a copyright with the US Copyright Office. Explain why it might be important to copyright the SVG Image you created. 

Here is a story about Kris. U.S. Department of Small Businesses protects Kris, a small business owner, from wage less work. Say he is the premiere SVG Image Designer of whole The U.S. and sells more images than Manjula. For currency, Manjula stole Kris's latest and greatest SVG image - a snapshot of the world's first electricity transmission. Kris did not sell his copyright and claims it is valid for 70 years after his death. Kris's copyright is registered with The U.S. Copyright Office, so Kris says his image is protected. Kris saw Manjula's store. Kris claims the store front shows his image. Kris sues Manjula for copyright infringement. Manjula pleads innocence. Manjula says she found Kris's image floating along a watery sewer stream. Manjula also says she did not know Kris owns a copyright. In court, Kris presents to our Judge his valid copyright to the SVG Image. Kris also presents his image of Manjula's storefront. Her motion is denied. 

As a student, I think The Fair Labor Standards Act requires we be paid for copyright infringement because copyrights, creative labor, and legal fees cost money. The law has already seen such a case.

* If the SVG Image you created became an item that identifies a source of goods or services, explain the role of a trademark in defining the intellectual property. 
 
As an object and a boundary line. Because trademarks are similarities business ideas share, if their decision was made first, then my idea is out of luck. That original creator for my infringement will receive compensation in a sue over their trademark ending my SVG Image. Do not mistake me, trademarks will waste time. If they are not obeyed, then expect a sue.
 
 
## Information Collection
* Explain how COPPA, FERPA and HIPPA restrict the collection of information on the Internet.

COPPA is the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act. FERPA is The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act. HIPPA is The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996. They filter contextual data - information. COPPA requires parental consent. FERPA protects education records. HIPPA seals health records. Those records serve a valid point in court. If they are unsealed, then their validity in court can be compromised. They are meant to be useful to our government.
